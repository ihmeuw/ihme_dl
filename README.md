# IHME Deep Learning  
  
This repo is to highlight an example of some of the Deep Learning projects taking place across IHME.  This model classifies images into outliers and not-outliers, but can be flexibly retrained to work with any multi-label or binary image classification exercise.  The Dockerfile in this repo can be used to replicate the environment used to train this model.  Any questions can be directed to alee91@uw.edu.
